# Week 6: Testing and Debugging MERN Applications

## Assignment Overview
This week focuses on implementing comprehensive testing strategies and debugging techniques for MERN stack applications. You'll learn to write unit tests, integration tests, and implement proper error handling.

## Learning Objectives
- Implement unit testing with Jest and React Testing Library
- Write integration tests for API endpoints
- Set up proper error handling and logging
- Use debugging tools effectively
- Implement test-driven development practices

## Tasks

### 1. Frontend Testing (React)
- Set up Jest and React Testing Library
- Write unit tests for React components
- Test user interactions and form submissions
- Mock API calls in tests
- Achieve minimum 80% test coverage

### 2. Backend Testing (Node.js/Express)
- Set up Jest for Node.js testing
- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Create integration tests for API endpoints
- Test database operations with test database
- Mock external dependencies

### 3. Error Handling & Debugging
- Implement global error handling middleware
- Add proper logging with Winston
- Create custom error classes
- Add input validation and sanitization
- Implement graceful error responses

### 4. Testing Best Practices
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Use descriptive test names
- Group related tests with describe blocks
- Set up proper test data and cleanup
- Use appropriate matchers and assertions

## Deliverables
1. Complete test suite for frontend components
2. API endpoint tests with proper mocking
3. Error handling middleware and custom errors
4. Logging system implementation
5. Updated documentation with testing instructions

## Evaluation Criteria
- Test coverage and quality
- Proper error handling implementation
- Code organization and best practices
- Documentation completeness
- Working application with all tests passing
